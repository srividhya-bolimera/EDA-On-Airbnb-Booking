        "The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset. EDA involves examining the dataset to find useful insights and patterns. By analyzing this data, we aim to discover how different factors affect property prices, understand which neighborhoods are more popular, and identify trends that can be useful for Airbnb hosts and potential guests.\n",

        "Data Analysis:\n",
        "Price Distribution: We examined how prices are distributed across different listings. This analysis showed that most properties are priced between 75 dollars and 500 dollars per night. There are fewer properties with very high or very low prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Room Type Analysis: We explored the different types of rooms available. We found that entire apartments or homes are the most common, followed by private rooms. Shared rooms are less common.\n",
        "\n",
        "Neighborhood Insights: By analyzing the locations of the properties, we discovered which neighborhoods are most popular and which have the highest prices. Manhattan generally has higher prices compared to other boroughs, while some neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens offer more affordable options.\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlation Analysis: We looked at how different factors like price, number of reviews, and availability relate to each other. For example, properties with higher prices tend to have fewer reviews, possibly indicating that high-end properties are booked less frequently but at a higher rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The exploratory data analysis of the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset provided valuable insights into the rental market in New York City. We learned about the distribution of prices, the popularity of different room types, and the variation in property prices across neighborhoods. These insights can help Airbnb hosts price their properties more effectively and guide guests in choosing accommodations based on their budget and preferences. Overall, this analysis helps in understanding the dynamics of the Airbnb market in NYC and can inform future decisions for both hosts and guests."
